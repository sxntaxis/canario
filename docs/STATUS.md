# Current Status

## Existing Authority

- Canonical civic content: `/mnt/Ginebra/Plaza/vault`.
- Processed baseline: Acta 161, 2026-05-18.
- Historical actas and curated Hilos are preserved; no mass regeneration is
  authorized.
- Nextcloud is a publication target. No live publication is authorized at this
  checkpoint.
- Current additive Hilo integration starts after the Acta 161 baseline.

## Architecture Decision Context

The next era of actakit is proposed as a federation of sovereign local civic
record nodes, not a Markdown-only pipeline or a single national database. It
will use named human approval roles, restricted raw evidence, minimal public
derivatives, and one new Esparza acta as the first vertical proof.

## Active Edge

```text
confirm post-161 official source coverage
-> review and accept target architecture
-> define policy/schema contracts
-> build semantic kernel
-> build custody/service foundation
-> process one new Esparza acta end to end
```

## Official Source Audit

Read-only checks on 2026-08-19 found:

- The official [Concejo archive](/articulo/230/actas-concejo-municipal) lists
  2026 records through Acta 161, dated 2026-05-18, and no later Concejo record.
- The official [Actas hub](/articulo/229/actas) links the Concejo, permanent
  commission, special commission, Junta Vial, and VideotecaCR repositories.
- The 2026 section of [Junta Vial](/articulo/231/actas-junta-vial) is present but
  contains no listed entries.
- [Permanent commissions](/articulo/609/actas-de-comisiones) expose one 2026
  item, `Dictamen Sociales N°1-2026`; this is not a Concejo acta.
- The official-linked [VideotecaCR archive](https://www.videotecacr.com/muniesparza/pages/galeria.php)
  renders period/month filters but no indexed video entries in the fetched
  response.
- The municipality's `/sesion` and `/video` pages render no embedded session or
  video in the fetched response.

The official YouTube channel now confirms post-161 session activity. Its streams
listing includes sessions 162 through 180; the individual page for Session 180
reports a live broadcast on 2026-08-17 and publication on 2026-08-18. The
official written archive still ends at Acta 161 on 2026-05-18, creating a
minimum 93-day written-publication gap as of this checkpoint.

The channel listing includes multiple sessions numbered 162 through 180 (with
some numbers absent from the visible listing). This proves a publication gap,
not the contents or approval status of any acta.
No post-161 written acta has been acquired into the vault. The information-
request draft now lives in the Plaza vault at
`4 Salidas/Oficios/Borradores/Oficio_Actas_y_Comisiones_Municipalidad.md`,
linked to its source evidence note. It remains unsigned and must be reviewed
before sending.

## Prohibitions Until the Vertical Proof

- No public client adapter, including writable MCP.
- No automatic public publication.
- No live Nextcloud writes.
- No historical vault regeneration.
- No claim of source verification without artifact, locator, and review record.
- No individual political-preference profiling or targeted-persuasion use.

## Evidence Used For This Checkpoint

- Current actakit implementation and Esparza vault integration.
- Digest local archive at `/home/sxntax/Downloads/Digest-main.zip`.
- `/mnt/Tokyo/Lab/Git/Plaza` architecture, data model, safeguards, and demo
  audits.
- `sxntaxis/notebook` and `sxntaxis/stereo-dev` architecture studies.

These studies inform the proposal. They do not automatically amend actakit
architecture or authorize implementation.

## 1.0 Planning

The proposed complete plan is in `ARCHITECTURE.md`, `CONTRACTS.md`,
`DATA_MODEL.md`, `IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md`, and `RELEASE_1_0.md`. These documents
require named human acceptance before service/database implementation begins.
